# Discovery: Delegated Insurance Coverage Assurance  
*Instance-grounded • Pattern-level • Prosocial by design*

---

## 1. Context & Current Reality (Baseline)

### Current state: ad-hoc discovery of failure

Today, coverage problems are discovered **reactively, fragmentedly, and accidentally**—after harm has already occurred.

**Typical discovery paths include:**

- **Unexpected bills**
  - “Why did PlushCare send me a bill for $123?”
  - Investigation reveals:
    - Claim denied on insurer website
    - Customer support says COBRA wasn’t active
    - This contradicts the individual’s knowledge that COBRA was paid on time

- **Unexpected coverage change notifications**
  - Email stating dependents are no longer covered
  - Resolution requires:
    - Contacting the insurer
    - Being redirected to the former employer
    - Employer coordinating with the COBRA administrator
    - Days later, written confirmation that it was “fixed”
    - Subsequent emails and portal checks to confirm restoration

**In all cases:**
- Discovery happens *after* claims or care are affected
- The individual reconstructs facts across multiple systems
- Resolution is slow, manual, and stressful

This is the status quo this discovery seeks to replace.

---

## 2. Counterfactual Insight (Why this problem exists)

> **This problem could be “solved” today by paying someone to check coverage every day.**

This reveals the core failure:
- Not correctness
- Not complexity
- **Who bears the cost of vigilance**

Institutions implicitly assume individuals will absorb that cost.

---

## 3. Core Problem (Restated Clearly)

> Individuals delegate health insurance administration to institutions but remain exposed to the consequences of silent failure, without reliable, continuous assurance that coverage is intact.

This leads to:
- Delayed discovery
- Preventable harm
- Cognitive and emotional burden
- Reinforced power asymmetry

---

## 4. Stakes & Priorities (Locked)

### Primary risk
- **Inability to access care**

### Priority order
1. Prevent disruption to care  
2. Prevent financial loss  
3. Prevent stress and uncertainty  

This ordering governs all future decisions.

---

## 5. Definition of Failure (Operational)

A failure is:

> Any lapse or inconsistency in eligibility or coverage status for any individual that affects access to care or claim adjudication—regardless of whether payment was made correctly.

**Clarifications:**
- Partial failures (e.g., dependents dropped) are equally unacceptable
- Initial focus: **eligibility / active status**
- Plan correctness is intentionally deferred

---

## 6. Detection Requirements

- **Detection latency:** ≤ 1 day
- No “safe windows”—risk is constant
- Discovery must occur *before*:
  - Claims are denied
  - Care is disrupted
  - Retroactive fixes become harder

---

## 7. Granularity of Assurance

- Confidence must exist at the **individual level**
- Family-level assertions are insufficient
- Each covered person’s eligibility matters independently

---

## 8. Ambiguity & Conflict Handling

Design preference:

> **Always explain conflicts.**

- Conflicting institutional states are surfaced
- Ambiguity is first-class
- False positives are preferred over false negatives
- Disagreement is never hidden or normalized away

---

## 9. Trust & Authority Model

- No single trusted source
- Verbal reassurance is insufficient
- Written confirmation from a human matters **only when a problem is being fixed**
- The system supports **justified confidence**, not blind trust

---

## 10. Desired Experience (Progressive Confidence)

### Phase 1: Transparency & inspection
- Ability to check status
- Ability to inspect underlying facts
- Repeated exposure builds confidence

### Phase 2: Reduced vigilance
- Manual checking decreases
- Silence becomes meaningful

### Phase 3: Steady-state assurance
- Zero involvement unless something breaks
- On-demand verification remains available

Success is *boring reliability*, not heroics.

---

## 11. Evidence & Preparedness

When something goes wrong, success means the individual can:

1. Know **that** something is wrong  
2. Know **what** is wrong (facts, not guesses)  
3. Use that information to **prove it to an institution**

Evidence is a primary output, not a byproduct.

---

## 12. Power Asymmetry (Explicit Motivation)

This problem reflects a structural asymmetry:
- Institutions control status
- Individuals bear consequences
- Detection responsibility is shifted to the individual

### Intentional counter-move

> **Encourage confidence in individuals to rebalance power against institutions.**

This is not adversarial; it restores symmetry between responsibility and observability.

---

## 13. Prosocial & Accessibility Commitment

This work is intentionally **prosocial**:

- Everyone should be able to trust that their coverage is correct
- Confidence should not require:
  - Technical skill
  - Time availability
  - Financial privilege

**Design intent:**
- Usable by non-technical people
- Accessible to the masses
- Technology serves people—not the reverse

---

## 14. Reuse & Generalization Intent

Trajectory:
1. Solve for one individual
2. Enable family use
3. Make available to others
4. Generalize across domains
5. Generalize across insurance types

Discovery is **domain-thin and pattern-thick** to support reuse.

---

## 15. Success Convincer

> **Seeing consistent status and underlying data multiple times until trust is earned.**

Trust is built through repetition and transparency—not promises.

---

## 16. One-Sentence Problem Statement (Final)

> Individuals lack continuous, trustworthy visibility into delegated insurance coverage, causing eligibility lapses that disrupt care and claims to be discovered only after harm occurs—reinforcing power asymmetry and forcing ongoing manual vigilance.

---

## 17. Discovery Completion Status

**Discovery has fully answered:**
- What problem is being solved
- Why current approaches fail
- What failure means
- What success means
- Who it is for
- Why it matters socially
- How it generalizes

**Intentionally deferred to planning/design:**
- Operationalization details
- Evidence formats
- State representations
- Measurement mechanisms
